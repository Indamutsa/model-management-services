Deploy NGINX Ingress Controller

   Before you deploy the NGINX Ingress Helm chart to the GKE cluster, add the nginx-stable Helm repository in Cloud Shell:

   #$: helm repo add nginx-stable https://helm.nginx.com/stable
   #$: helm repo update

   Deploy an NGINX controller Deployment and Service by running the following command:

   #$: helm install nginx-ingress nginx-stable/nginx-ingress

   Verify that the nginx-ingress-controller Deployment and Service are deployed to the GKE cluster:

   #$: kubectl get deployment nginx-ingress-nginx-ingress
   #$: kubectl get service nginx-ingress-nginx-ingress
